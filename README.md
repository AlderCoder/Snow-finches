# Snow-finches
Stats Lab Project for Group Bird

Plumage coloration of white-winged snowfinches, a high-elevation bird species, is very similar in
males and female but the sexes might differ in morphological traits such as wing length, feather
length or bill length. For a population dynamics study, we ring and measure snowfinches and take
salivary samples to genetically sex the birds. We are interested in developing a classification
method to use morphological traits for sexing the birds when we donâ€™t have genetic data.
